// NOTE: Search about index in mongodb. Search why --> creating an index can take some time if you have a lot of documents in your collection. Itâ€™s usually best to create indexes during periods of low load or during maintenance windows.
// Create an index on the 'createdAt' field
PostSchema.index({ createdAt: -1 });
